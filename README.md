# Movie-Data-Graph-Creator
This program includes a keyword search function for movie titles and will allow the user to specify which movies they want to see 
data about. Based upon the movies selected by the user (and are available in the .csv file) the program will save graphs showing ratings 
by age groups of the selected films and how raters were distributed across gender-age groups. 

You will need to have the IMDB.csv file saved in a folder in your working directory in order for this to work. The graphs produced by the
program will also be saved in the working directory.
